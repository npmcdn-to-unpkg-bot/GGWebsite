## Flux Starter Kit

This is the accompanying starter kit for the Flux Quick Start Guide.

## Setup

*You must have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) installed on your computer.*

`git clone https://github.com/jarsbe/flux-starter-kit.git`

`cd flux-starter-kit`

`npm install`

This will install all dependencies. The dependencies for this kit include.

- Flux
- React
- Object Assign
- Webpack
- JSX Loader

## Running

To build the project, first run this command:

`npm start`

This will make Webpack watch the project and build a new `bundle.js` file on each change. It also starts a Python server.

Visit `localhost:8000` and you should see the text `Great Scott, it works!`

With that setup and running you can continue following along with the guide.
